            Welcome to the Section of Off-campus life and Student Development Programmes. The Off-Campus Life Office is committed to supporting the needs and welfare of off-campus students. This is achieved through assisting students to get affordable accommodation, and by initiating programmes that promote good order, discipline and a congenial living and learning environment. There are several boarding houses with high quality facilities such as beds, reading desk and chair, Wi-Fi water, tanks and kitchen facilities. We provide programmes that keep off-campus students connected to campus activities and services, as well as facilitating the use of community resources, such as halls and stadia by the students. Further, the office helps create positive relations between off campus students and their landlords and the community at large. Our students are the CUT image makers in society, hence the need for them to live responsibly, observing community standards and in full compliance of the university's code of student discipline. We also provide literature and education on safety and security, being a good neighbour and tips on harmonious room sharing as well as managing the social risks that affect off campus students. Our offices are located at the Sports Pavillion.

                    CUT On and Off Campus Life offices co-ordinate a vast number of student clubs and societies. Participating in one or more of these clubs is the best way to stay connected to the campus and meet fellow students with common interest. However, if you have an interest or concern that is not catered for, you are free to start a new club and contact the Directors for On and Off Campus Life and Student Development Programmes who will assist you to register your club.

                    The mere thinking of staying off-campus can create some anxieties on many students. However, it is my submission that if you graduate without having experienced life off-campus, you would not have experienced university life in its totality. Life off-campus gives you the exposure and experience you would not get in campus, of being responsible for all the details of daily needs. You are faced with the realities of ever day life like paying rent and making choices that impact on you as a tenant, a neighbour and a citizen of the Chinhoyi community. At the same time you are still a CUT student and you are expected to abide by CUTâ€™s student code of conduct.

                    You must consider health and safety standards when searching for a room. Look carefully at the following in any building for your health and safety. 1. Structural elements e.g. walls, floors, doors, windows, ceilings, roofs: these must be in good working order. 2. Electricity and wiring: no naked wires. 3. Ventilation: there must be windows and air vents in every room.
